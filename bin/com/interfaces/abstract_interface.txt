Abstraction: hiding of implementation details
--interface are incomplete methods or abstract in nature
- where class consists of complete method.
- by default abstract keyword added for the incomplete method in interface
- class ---> class = extends keyword
- interface ---> interface = extends keyword
- interface --- > class = implements keyword
- multiple inheritance is achieved through interface
- can class extends other class and implements interface at same point - yes
  (sequence matters first extend and next implements)
