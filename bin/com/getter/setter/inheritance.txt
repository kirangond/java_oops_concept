-----Inheritance-----
- Inheritance (here we inherit the members from the parent to child class with an intention to reuse those members)
- we can write multiple classes in a single class file (not recommended)
- only 1 class should be public in it and i.e the class with file name

- using extend keyword we will inherit in other class
- parent(super) child(sub class) 
- without inheritance we can also access the members of the other class by creating object of the class and remove extends keyword but it will be not inheritance

- sequential inheritance  class A{} class B extends A{} class C extends B{}

- multiple inheritance - extending more than 1 class class A extends B, C{} -- not supported in java
